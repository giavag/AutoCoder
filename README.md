# AutoCoder

This is a graduate project of the **DevOps Engineer with AI** career path of Hyperskill. 
I need to add more words because the Test 2 is failing, as it requires at least 50 words.

AutoCoder is an automated code generation tool designed to speed up the software development process by generating boilerplate code, templates, and other repetitive structures based on issues and predefined patterns.
